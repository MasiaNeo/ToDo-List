Simple JavaScript To-Do List
This is a straightforward and interactive To-Do List application built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It's designed to help you keep track of your tasks, mark them as complete, and delete them when they're no longer needed.

✨ Features
Add Tasks: Quickly add new tasks to your list using an input field and an "Add" button, or simply by pressing Enter.
Time Tracking: Each task automatically displays the time it was added, helping you remember when you jotted it down.
Mark as Complete: Click on any task to "scratch it off" with a strikethrough effect, visually indicating that it's done. Click again to unmark it.
Delete Tasks: Remove unwanted tasks from your list with a dedicated "Delete" button next to each item.
Responsive Design: The layout adjusts to fit different screen sizes.
